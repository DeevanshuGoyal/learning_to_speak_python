You are given 2 files - India_covid.txt and Canada_covid.txt.

Each file contains 3 columns - Confirmed_Cases, Deaths and Recovered.

Every row corresponds to the number of cases on a particular date, with the last row corresponding to May 3rd. There is data for 50 days, so each file has 51 rows (first row gives names of columns).

Your task is to read both the files, and store the number of confirmed cases in each file into 2 lists. Then you should plot these two lists together to see how the growth of COVID in India and Canada compares over the past 50 days!
